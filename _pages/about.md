🌟 Hi! I'm Arati, a Master’s student at Georgia Tech specializing in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing. My academic path is enriched by my deep interest in making technology work seamlessly and efficiently, particularly when it comes to applications like Deep Learning and Hardware Acceleration.

🔧  I’m particularly captivated by Machine Learning Systems (MLSys), a field where the goal is to enhance the operational efficiency and scalability of machine learning models beyond theoretical confines. My work involves optimizing the performance of these models across various platforms, from mobile devices to server clusters, ensuring that they deliver robust, real-world functionality.

🛠️ My approach combines hands-on problem-solving with a swift adaptability to new challenges and technologies. I'm excited about the possibility of making smarter systems that are both powerful and user-friendly.

🚀 I love connecting with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts who are keen to explore how we can make technology simpler and smarter together. Let’s get in touch!
