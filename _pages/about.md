🌟 Hi! I'm Arati, a Master’s student at Georgia Tech specializing in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing. My academic path is enriched by my deep interest in making technology work seamlessly and efficiently, particularly when it comes to applications like Deep Learning and Hardware Acceleration.

🔧 I'm especially drawn to the practical side of technology — what's known as Machine Learning Systems (MLSys). This area is all about getting machine learning models to perform well not just in the lab, but in real-life applications. Whether it’s improving how quickly a model runs on a smartphone or ensuring it scales up on servers, I am passionate about making these solutions realistic and usable.

🛠️ My approach combines hands-on problem-solving with a swift adaptability to new challenges and technologies. I'm excited about the possibility of making smarter systems that are both powerful and user-friendly.

🚀 I love connecting with like-minded professionals and enthusiasts who are keen to explore how we can make technology simpler and smarter together. Let’s get in touch!
